Application is shutting down on the web server. 
The request is not processed because the destination application pool is shutting down. Wait for the worker process to finish shutting down, and then try the request again. If this problem persists, the web application may be experiencing problems that prevent the web application from shutting down correctly.
500.12
Application is busy restarting on the web server. 
The request is not processed because the destination application pool is restarting. This HTTP status code should disappear when you refresh the page. If this HTTP status code appears again after you refresh the page, the problem may be caused by antivirus software that is scanning the Global.asa file. If this problem persists, the web application may be experiencing problems that prevent the web application from restarting correctly.
500.13
Web server is too busy. 
The request is not processed because the server is too busy to accept any new incoming requests.

This problem may occur because the performance configuration settings are set too low, the hardware is insufficient, or a bottleneck occurs in the IIS 7.0, IIS 7.5, or IIS 8.0 web application. A common troubleshooting method is to generate a memory dump file of the IIS 7.0, IIS 7.5, or IIS 8.0 processes when the error is occurring and then to debug the memory dump file.
